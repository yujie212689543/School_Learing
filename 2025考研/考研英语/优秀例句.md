1. **If Hugh Miller, after toiling all day in a quarry, had devoted his evenings to rest and recreation, he would never have become a famous geologist.**[[If I Rest, I Rust]]

本句是虚拟语气！虚拟语气在考研英语阅读中非常重要。对过去的事实虚拟，句型结构为 <font color="#e36c09">if... had done..., would have done...</font>建议熟读，最好背诵。after toiling all day in a quarry 这部 分的作用为插入语，在背诵时可以去掉。

2. <font color="#e36c09">Those // who would attain the heights // reached and kept by great men // must keep their faculties polished by constant use</font>   [[If I Rest, I Rust]]

主语是those,谓语动词must keep;难点在于those后的修饰成分较长，首先是who引导定 语从句，紧接着reached and kept by great men过去分词作后置定语修饰heights o整句话连起 来翻译：“那些<font color="#e36c09">想</font>达到伟人所达到和保持的高度的人，必须不断地运用他们的才能。”

3. <font color="#0070c0">The longer it takes you to recover, the more influence that incident has on your actions, and the less able you are to perform to your personal best.</font>  [[Facing the Enemies Within]]

本句的结构为：the+比较级…,the+比较级…，and the +比较级… 即“越........，就越翻译为：你需要的恢复时间越长，那个事件对你的影响越大，你也就越不能做到最好。
